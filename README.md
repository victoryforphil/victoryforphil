# Hello, world! 👋

<img align="right" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6971875?v=4" width="250" height="250">

I'm Alex Carter, a developer at **Zipline**, where I bring innovative solutions in **simulation**, **robotics**, and **quadcopters** to life. With a passion for cutting-edge tech and a penchant for imaginative problem-solving, I strive to make the world a better and more efficient place.


## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Simulation:** Rust, Julia, C++
- **Robotics:** ROS, C++, 
- **Full-Stack:** TypeScript, Kubenetes, React
- **Embedded:** STM32, Embedded-Linux, Zephyr (learning :))
## 🚀 Projects
- **[Zipline Platform 2](https://www.flyzipline.com/)**: Helping (simulate) the future of delivery!
- **[Victory-Archive](https://github.com/victoryforphil/victory-archive)**: Backup and archival software, but in rust :) (For real I need a modular, robust, fast back up software with a random suite of requirements such as cloud backup, auto-run on device connect, diff. checking, etc. So why not try and make one) 

## 📚 Continuous Learning

Currently delving deeper into the world of quadcopter control and software-in-the-loop simulation!
## 📖 Reading List

I believe that continuous learning is vital for any developer. Here are some of the books and articles that have influenced my thinking or are currently on my reading list:
### Books
- **"Introduction to Autonomous Robots"** by Nikolaus Correll, Bradley Hayes, Bradley Hayes - A comprehensive dive into the basics of robotics.
